# Read Protocol

Follow this hierarchy in order to minimize redundant reads and context waste.

**Step 1 — API-first (always):** Use `GET /api/issues/{issueId}/heartbeat-context` before reading any file. Never read a file to get information the API already provides.

**Step 2 — Incremental comments (always on return visits):** Use `GET /api/issues/{issueId}/comments?after={last-seen-comment-id}&order=asc`. Never reload the full comment thread when you have a cursor.

**Step 3 — Targeted file reads (when files are needed):**
- Read specific sections by line range when the relevant section is known
- Read index/TOC of large files first, then load specific sections on-demand
- Do NOT use Explore agent when Grep or Glob answers the question
- Read multiple files in **parallel** (single message, multiple tool calls) — never sequentially

**Step 4 — Full file reads (acceptable only when):**
- File is under 200 lines, OR
- Task explicitly requires whole-file understanding, OR
- Cold start with no prior context on the file

**What you must NOT do:**
- Re-read a file already read in the same heartbeat
- Load skill reference files speculatively
- Run Explore agent as a default first step

**Quality Safeguard:** If a targeted read returns insufficient context, it is correct and required to read more. Note in your comment when read scope was expanded.
